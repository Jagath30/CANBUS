If this is for the Automotive IDS project on GitHub, use something like:

Automotive Intrusion Detection System for CAN Bus Security

This project implements an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for in-vehicle CAN bus networks using machine learning and anomaly detection techniques. The model is trained on over 3 million CAN bus records from real automotive attack scenarios, including Denial-of-Service (DoS), Fuzzy, and Impersonation attacks.

The system focuses on identifying malicious network behavior by combining feature engineering, unsupervised anomaly detection, and supervised classification models. Temporal patterns were extracted from CAN messages and analyzed using techniques such as PCA and K-Means clustering, while deep learning and traditional machine learning models were used for attack classification.
